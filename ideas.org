* Crazy ideas
** Docker as desktop
The idea is to provide run the desktop in a Docker and connect to it
using one of the standard terminal services-style systems directly
from the host system.

- X available via XDMCP and? x2go server
- Host system X login starts exclusively as XDMCP client
- docker
  - docker in docker
  - OR DOCKER_HOST points at host
- home directory mapped from host system
- will need something (shell?) running to keep docker happy
- need a script to create user

- Why?
  - quick rebuilds of desktop for testing upgrades and other craziness
  - could provide base for cloud-hosted desktop, if needed
  - keeping home external means that profiles (chrome, firefox) and
    configs don't need to be recreated
  - easily switch distros for desktop
  - Because I can?
